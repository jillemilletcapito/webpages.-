Eggplant is reported to exhibit antioxidative functions, to show anticancer effects, to lower cholesterol levels, and to reduce the risk of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. This health-promoting ability of eggplant is attributed to the high content of phenols, mainly chlorogenic acid.
