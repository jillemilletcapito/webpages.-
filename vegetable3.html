    <p>
        <strong>Broccoli</strong> (Brassica oleracea var. italica) is a biennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family that is eaten as a vegetable throughout the world. The word “Broccoli” is derived from the Latin word “brachium” which means branch or arm. Broccoli is a popular vegetable known to the Greeks for 2500 years. In a phylogenetic chart broccoli is placed in family Brassicaceae, genus Brassica, along with cabbage, cauliflower, kale, turnip, mustard, and Brussels sprouts. They were being cultivated for food by the civilizations of Persia and of China over 8000 years ago. The origins of broccoli can be traced back to coastal Europe; sprouting broccoli and wild cabbage can still be found on the chalk cliffs of the United Kingdom and the Low Countries.
