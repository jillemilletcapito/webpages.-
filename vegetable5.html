    <h1>Potato</h1>

    <p>
        The <strong>potato</strong> is a starchy tuber of the plant Solanum tuberosum. Tubers are a type of organ that some plants use to store nutrients. Potatoes are one type of root vegetable. This name refers to any underground part of a plant that is eaten by humans, regardless of whether it actually is a root. Tubers, such as potatoes, are not roots because they are not used by the plant to take in water and nutrients.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>potato</strong> plant's tubers, or organs for storing nutrients (as opposed to bringing in nutrients, which is what roots do), grow underground. They are the only part of the plant that humans eat. Even though ''potato'' is the name of the plant as a whole, the tubers are what is almost always meant by ''potato.''
