    <p>
        <strong>Radish</strong>, Raphanus sativus L., is an annual vegetable belonging to the family Cruciferae and is a traditionally important vegetable in many countries. The enlarged root and hypocotyl of radish are consumed mainly as a salted vegetable and are also eaten fresh as grated radish, garnish, and salad. Radish has been cultivated and consumed as a part of the eastern Asian diet.

    <p>
        <strong>Radish</strong> is mainly consumed fresh, boiled, or salted or as dried strips or seedlings (kaiware). Radish is an allogamous plant exhibiting a high level of self-incompatibility and shows inbreeding depression when self-propagation by bud pollination is repeated. It is difficult to obtain a large amount of seed mainly because of the limited seed numbers produced per pod.
